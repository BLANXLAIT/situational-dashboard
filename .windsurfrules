Always read the CONTEXT.md file in the root of this project before beginning any work. 

It contains our strict architectural constraints, technology stack rules (Node 22, TypeScript, Firebase v2 API design), and security mandates (CORS).

If you are asked to create a new component, write a new Firebase Function, or alter the UI, you MUST verify that your plan aligns with the rules established in CONTEXT.md.
